# React Concepts Demonstration

This repository contains a comprehensive collection of React.js applications demonstrating various concepts from basics to advanced features. Each project is designed to focus on specific aspects of React development.This repository contains multiple React applications demonstrating various fundamental concepts of React.js. Each project focuses on specific React features and patterns to help understand React development.

### Core React Concepts

1. **React Basics** (`react-basics/`)

   - Components and JSX
     - Basic React component structure
     - JSX syntax
   - Props and State
   - Props and component communication
   - Simple state management
   - List Rendering with Keys
   - Student List and Shopping List examples

### React Hooks

2. **React Hooks** (`react-hooks/`)

   - useState : add state to function components.
   - useEffect : run side-effects (API calls, timers, subscriptions).
   - useRef : persist values across renders, access DOM elements.
   - useContext : access global data (like theme, user info).
   - useReducer : advanced state management
   - useCallback, useMemo : optimize performance.
   - Custom Hooks

### React Routing

3. **React Router Examples**

   - Basic Routing (`react-router/`)
   - Declarative Routing (`router-app/`)
   - Data Fetching with Router API (`router-app-data-api/`)
   - Route Parameters- Context API implementation
   - Protected Routes- Custom hooks

### State management using Redux

4. **Redux Implementation**## Key Concepts Demonstrated

   - Redux Fundamentals (`redux-basics/`)
   - Modern Redux with Redux Toolkit (`redux-toolkit/`)
   - Redux Store Configuration

### Additional Features

5. **Specialized Demonstrations**-

   - Authentication Implementation (`auth-demo/`)
   - Modal Dialogs (`modal-demo/`)
   - React vs DOM Manipulation (`react-vs-dom-demo/`)

## Key Concepts Covered## Getting Started

## Getting Started

1. Navigate to any project directory:
   `cd <project-directory>`
2. Install dependencies:
   `npm install`
3. Run the development server:
   `npm run dev`
